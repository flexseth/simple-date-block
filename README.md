# Simple Date Block
A really simple date block that outputs the current date based on how the user has their WordPress installation configured to show dates.

This is a proof of concept, and showcases use of dynamic block building and using php to render.

### TODO

- [ ] Sanitize Output
- [ ] Internationalization
- [ ] Formatting / block controls
- [ ] Test in header, main, sidebar footer templates
- [ ] Add option to allow block to render in users locale, instead of site timezone

### Block Editor
- [ ] Backend UI (edit.js) - Server Side render on admin, or pull from save attributes

### Customize surrounding text
- Toggle "Today's Date is " on and off
- Allow custom before and after text.

### Roadmap
- Allow users to set custom date format
- Styleable
- Match to theme styles
- Create JavaScript version
- Caching?
